# Restructure flat data to wide format

Use case scenario:
If you have data in spread format, but you want to restructure it to wide format,
while keeping useful information from the variable name. 

Consider that you have coded information in the variable name. 
For instance one variable is reapeated for multiple brands with "_[brand_code]" as sufix.

# Purpose

The script restructures the data while keeping the useful information in the variable name

# Usage

The script uses the JSON file as a basis for the restructure information. Currently the JSON file is made by hand.
